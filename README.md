### jQuery 202 & Web Components

This years meetups will be split into two parts. The first hour will be about a beginner focussed topic and in the second part we will talk about a more advanced related topic. This time:

#### jQuery 202

- Un-spaghetti and modularize your code
- Advanced selectors and DOM traversal
- Making your code faster
- Writing your own plugins

#### Web components - the future of web development

- Introduction to web components and Polymer
- Data driven views (or why direct DOM manipulation will be a thing of the past)
- Build web component style applications now with CanJS
